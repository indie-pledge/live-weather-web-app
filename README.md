to fully make the web based weather app work, you have to get a free api key from openweathermap.org and then input the api key in the javascript where it says "YOUR_API_KEY"
replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your api key
Remember that mine was for Windsor, Ontario, Canada.
replace the JavaScript inner text with the place you want to display with the weather app.
